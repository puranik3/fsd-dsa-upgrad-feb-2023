## Communicable disease
// NOTE: The variable is d and the function is n(d)
It takes 3 days to double
n(d) = 10 * 2^d (exponential)

d           Cases
0           10
1           20
2           40
3           80
4           160

## Another disease that grows differently
n(d) = d^2 + 10 (polynomial)
d           Cases
0           10
1           11
2           14
3           19


## When it is algorithms the function we evaluate is time to solve a problem of size n 
T(n) = nlogn

n       Running time (T(n))
1       0
2       2
4       8
8       24
16      64

T(n) = n^2
n       T(n)
// Homework
1       1
2       4



T(n) = log(n) * log(n)
n       T(n)
