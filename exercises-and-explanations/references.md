# Websites to visit for practice
When you start practising it is recommended you try easy problems, till you are comfortable solving them. Code Wars has problems of all sill levels.

Once you are comfortable with the easy problems, try tougher ones on these sites. Again the problems are marked with difficulty levels, and with the percentage of people solving them. Try the easy ones, then move onto higher difficulty levels. Take the help of discussion boards when solving them.
