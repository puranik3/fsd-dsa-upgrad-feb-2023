# String - Exercises
1. We are given a 2D array of characters and a character pattern. Give an algorithm to find if pattern is present in 2D array. Patterns can be in any way ( all neighbors to be considered ) but we can’t use the same character twice while matching .

2. Given a string, find the smallest window length with all distinct characters of the given string. For eg. str = “aabcbcdbca”, then the result would be 4 as of the smallest window will be “dbca” .

3. Write a program to print all permutations of a given string  

A permutation also called an “arrangement number” or “order,” is a rearrangement of the elements of an ordered list S into a one-to-one correspondence with S itself. A string of length n has n! permutation. 

Below are the permutations of string ABC.
